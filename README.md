**Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning and NLP**

**OverView**: 
The Twitter Sentiment Analysis project aims to determine the sentiment of tweets, classifying them as positive or negative. This is achieved by leveraging machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

**Objectives**:
Understand Public Opinion: Analyze tweets to gauge public sentiment on various topics, such as products, events, or social issues.
Automate Sentiment Analysis: Develop a robust model that can automatically classify the sentiment of tweets in real-time or from a dataset.
Improve Decision-Making: Provide valuable insights to businesses, researchers, and policymakers based on the sentiment analysis.

**Key Components**:
Data Collection: Downloaded about 1.6 Million tweets from Kaggle Dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the tweets by removing irrelevant information (e.g., URLs, mentions, hashtags), Stemming the text, and eliminating stop words.
Feature Extraction: Convert the preprocessed text into numerical features using techniques like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
Model Training: Train various machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest, to classify the sentiment of tweets.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and select the best-performing model.

**Technologies Used**:
Python: For data processing, modeling, and evaluation.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Sklearn, NLTK, and others for NLP and machine learning tasks.

**Model**:
The project uses various machine learning models for sentiment analysis, including:
# Logistic Regression
# Support Vector Machine (SVM)
# Random Forest

**Results**
The models are evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Below are the results for the best-performing model:
# Accuracy: 85%
# Precision: 84%
# Recall: 83%
# F1-score: 83%
